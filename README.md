# Ethereum-Historic-Data-Dashboard

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.
Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014 and officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015.
Ethereumâ€™s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.
 
 What makes Ethereum unique?
 Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.
 
 In this dataset, it primariliy consist of 7 columns (data, price, open, high, low, volume, change %), an additional column (year) and total 1980 rows.
 The dataset is taken from kaggel (https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/ethereum-cryptocurrency-historical-dataset/version/10?select=Ethereum+Historical+Data.csv) which is in the date range from 10/march/2016 to 9/august/2021.
